User persona implementation

In a user persona, it’s important to adjunct a photo of yourself, so the people can see how you look, and obviously your name and age. This is the most important part so I’m going to put the photo in the middle and the name the first text you can see.
It’s also important to have a little description of your life. I will put this on the top also, but for me it’s less important so it will go to the right.
Then you must explain your goals and needs, this is also important so it will go to the center, just under the photo.
Also you must put what motivates you and your job experience. This will go next to the goals and needs, it’s important but not the main thing.
And last but not least we must explain our skills and personality. This is really important and also can be something that's very heavy to read, so I'm going to make it very visual
The color patterns will be sophisticated, this way, they will know that we are gentlemen (e.g., Navy Blue, Gold, Cream).
